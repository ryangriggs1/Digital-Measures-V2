# Digital Measures V2
V2 of my digital measures project allows the user to specify the required changes that need to be applied to the file! This is a simple and easy to use csv converter that I made for the administrations office at my school. They can use this to convert the headers and the class names with a couple button presses as opposed to changing thousands of lines by hand.
